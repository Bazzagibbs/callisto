# Callisto Engine

Desktop game engine written in [Odin](https://odin-lang.org).

[Engine documentation](https://bazzagibbs.com/docs) (WIP)

## Creating an application

**Please look at Callisto Sandbox for the most up-to-date usage of the engine.**

An example application can be found at [BazzaGibbs/callisto-sandbox](https://github.com/bazzagibbs/callisto-sandbox).

**THIS SECTION IS CURRENTLY BEING REWRITTEN**

## In progress

- Runner and hot reloading

## Project Plan

- Input abstraction
- Immediate-mode rendering for debug UI
- Asset saving and loading
- Retained 2D/UI/sprite rendering
- Maybe ECS for scene management - gameplay will probably be managed outside of the ECS
- HDRI skybox lighting
- Audio
- SHIP A GAME
